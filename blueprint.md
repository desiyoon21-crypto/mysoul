# Kickboard Reporting App

## Overview

This application allows users to report illegally parked or abandoned kickboards. The user can scan the kickboard's QR code, capture the location, upload a photo of the violation, and categorize the issue. This creates a comprehensive report that can be sent to the responsible authorities or kickboard company.

## Features

*   **QR Code Scanner:** To quickly identify the kickboard.
*   **Geolocation:** To pinpoint the location of the kickboard.
*   **Photo Upload:** To provide visual evidence of the violation.
*   **Violation Classification:** To categorize the type of parking violation.
*   **Image Preview:** To allow users to preview the selected image before submission.
*   **Remove Image:** To allow users to remove the selected image.
*   **Success Message:** To provide feedback to the user after submitting a report.
*   **Responsive Design:** The app will be designed to work well on both mobile devices and desktops.

## Design and Style

*   **Layout:** A single-page application interface.
*   **Theme:** A clean and modern design with a focus on usability.
*   **Color Palette:** A simple and intuitive color scheme.
*   **Typography:** Clear and legible fonts.
*   **Iconography:** Use of icons to enhance user experience.

## Current Task: Implement Success Message

I will add a success message to the application. This will involve:
- Adding a success message element to `index.html`.
- Updating `main.js` to show the success message after a report is submitted.
- Adding styling for the success message in `style.css`.
